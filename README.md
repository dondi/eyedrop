# eyedrop

This is a simple web page that is inspired by classic “eyedropper” image processing tool…and the great dress debate of 2015.

The page uses a straightforward `canvas` element to load an image and display it. Mousing over the element will display
the RGB value of the pixel underneath the mouse, including a larger swatch of the color.

The page was inspired by the big white-and-gold vs. blue-and-black dress debate. It isn’t meant to settle the issue, but
to provide objective information about the color data in the pixels.
